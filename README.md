# **J.A.R.V.I.S**

This application is modeled after J.A.R.V.I.S from Ironman owned by Marvel Comics. I do not own the name, but the code is based on the fundamental features of a Large Language Processing (LLP) system.

This application allows for interacting with a Large Language model and then speaking its response.

# Future Updates

 - [ ] Speech to Text - Allowing a user to talk to the application and have the response read back.
 - [ ]  Improve the voice feature.
 - [ ]  Add custom responses to specific questions, especially those not allowed by LLM default settings.
